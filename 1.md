RESP

TLDR; - If you want free money for your child's education, go NOW and open a RESP account.

RESPs - we have all heard about them, we have seen posters around us, but I'm not sure why most Canadians do not open one for their kids. A survey by CPA revealed that almost 47% of the Canadians parents have not opened one. I find this so difficult to fathom that Canadians are leaving the free money being given by the government. And, these are the same Canadians, who will price match their groceries.

Well, what is RESP ?
Education is getting expensive by the day. Surpise surprise, it is a Registered Education Savings Plan
